            <h3 id="top">Determining the Ages of the Planets and the Universe</h3>
            <p>
                <strong>Paragraph 1:</strong> The planets of our solar system all revolve around the Sun in the same
                direction and in
                orbits that lie in nearly
                the same plane. This is strong evidence that the planets formed simultaneously from a single disk of
                material that rotated in
                the same direction as the modern planets.<br />

                <strong>Paragraph 2:</strong>Precisely when the planets came into being has been a difficult issue to
                resolve. While
                Earth’s
                water is necessary for life, its abundance near the planet’s surface makes rapid erosion inevitable.
                Continuous
                alteration of the crust by erosion and also by igneous (volcanic) and metamorphic (pressure and heat
                within Earth)
                processes makes unlikely any discovery of rocks nearly as old as Earth. Thus geologists have had to look
                beyond this
                planet in their efforts to date Earth’s origin. Fortunately, we do have samples of rock that appear to
                represent the
                primitive material of the solar system. These samples are meteorites, which originate as
                extraterrestrial objects, called<br />
                meteors, that have been captured in Earth’s gravitational field and have then crashed into our planet.
                <strong>Paragraph 3:</strong>Some meteorites consist of rocky material and, accordingly, are called
                stony meteorites.
                Others are metallic and have been designated iron meteorites even though they contain lesser amounts of
                elements
                other than iron. Still others consist of mixtures of rocky and metallic material and thus are called
                stony-iron
                meteorites. Meteors come in all sizes, from small particles to the small planets known as asteroids; no
                asteroid,
                however, has struck Earth during recorded human history. Many meteorites appear to be fragments of
                larger
                bodies
                that have undergone collisions and broken into pieces. Iron meteorites are fragments of the interiors of
                these bodies,
                comparable to Earth’s core, and stony meteorites are from outer portions of these bodies, comparable to
                Earth’s
                mantle (the layer between the core and outer crust).<br />
                <strong>Paragraph 4:</strong>Meteorites have been radiometrically dated by means of several decay
                systems, including
                rubidium-strontium,
                potassium-argon, and uranium-thorium. The dates thus derived tend to cluster around 4.6 billion years,
                which
                suggests
                that this is the approximate age of the solar system. After many meteorites had been dated, it was
                gratifying to find
                that the oldest ages obtained for rocks gathered on the surface of the Moon also were approximately 4.6
                billion years.
                This must, indeed, be the age of the solar system. Ancient rocks can be found on the Moon because the
                lunar
                surface,
                unlike that of Earth, has no water to weather and erode rocks and is characterized by only weak
                movements of
                its crust.<br />
                <strong>Paragraph 5:</strong>Determining the age of the universe has been more complicated. Most stars
                in the universe
                are
                clustered into enormous disk-like galaxies. The distance between our galaxy, known as the Milky Way, and
                all
                others is increasing. In fact, all galaxies are moving away from one another, evidence that the universe
                is
                expanding. It is not the galaxies themselves that are expanding but the space between them. What is
                happening is analogous to inflating a balloon with small coins attached to its surface. The coins behave
                like galaxies: although they do not expand, the space between them does. Before the galaxies formed,
                matter
                that they contain was concentrated with infinite density at a single point from which it exploded in an
                event called the big bang. Even after it assembled into galaxies, matter continued to spread in all
                directions from the site of the big bang.<br />
                <strong>Paragraph 6:</strong>The evidence that the universe is expanding makes it possible to estimate
                its age. This
                evidence, called the redshift, is an increase in the wavelengths of light waves traveling through
                space—a
                shift toward the red end of the visible spectrum of wavelengths. Expansion of the space between galaxies
                causes this shift by stretching light waves as they pass through it. The farther these light waves have
                traveled through space, the greater the redshift they have undergone. For this reason, light waves that
                reach Earth from distant galaxies have larger redshifts than those from nearby galaxies. Calculations
                based
                on these redshifts indicate that about 13.7 billion years ago all of the galaxies would have been at one
                spot, the site of the big bang. This, then, is the approximate date of the big bang and the age of the
                universe.
